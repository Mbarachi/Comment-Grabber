S Green, Sun Sep 08 2019, Youre marriage is as good as your singleness. Solid truth. 
Mwende Munyoki, Fri Aug 30 2019, Divorce is in deed awful. I got the miraculous healing of Holy Spirit. It&#39;s hard to introduce yourself as  a divorcee. The community takes you for an outcast. Instead of helping you heal,  they help get more sick. You can only rely on Jesus. <br /><br />By grace, I got healed through Jesus Christ before I got sick. <br /><br />Great message. It&#39;s possible to stay single and faithful but not good to be alone. 
Lerato Accadia, Thu Aug 29 2019, I loves how he honored and respected her. 
La B, Sat Aug 24 2019, God will not send you a deficit! AMEN! All this time I thought I was a problem. Mrs. Munroe’s statement confirms my belief. God saves his best for his best! The advantage of patiently waiting... Just wait on God! So happy to have run across this message. Even a false marriage (having intercourse with someone who is not your husband/wife). 
Mina Oparebia, Sat Aug 24 2019, Amen to Glory <br />Thank you God. <br />Hallelujah 🙏🙏🙏🙌👏

Emokiriemi Abednego, Fri Jul 26 2019, Smartness is mandatory in a relationship and cyberhackinggenius helped cloned my spouse device and I got access to all his dealings both on phone and social media without touching his devices. All I did was share my husband’s phone number with cyberhackinggenius and I was able to read both his new and deleted messages from a cloned device without having to touch his phone. I read all his Whatsapp, Facebook,Instagram and Snapchat messages Including the deleted text messages and iMessages. You can contact him via Gmail  (cyberhackinggenius) or text and speak to him directly on his phone and WhatsApp : +19256795146 and don’t forget to thank me later 
Aries Eagle, Fri Jul 26 2019, Pastor Munroe,good day to u from India.I listen to u regularly,n with all respect,I must confess ,my divorce has not been the death of everything.20years did not get me where I am today,n as a divorcer for 13 years I now have Jesus.Had the relation &quot;NOT DIED&quot;,I wouldn&#39;t&#39;be here .Here I am today,happy as a lark n no regrets.Lastly many divorces happened out of no options.Been there,done it n I do know.God bless you with your marriage. 
Adams Eneh, Sat Jul 20 2019, Who’s gonna take me to lunch 🤔🤔🤔🥰🥰🥰❤️❤️ 
Constance Sawyer, Fri Jul 19 2019, Singleness means you are called to Celibacy . I&#39;m successfully single now for 10 years not based on lack of desire . Rather a change of my devotion . Most of what we endure is based on personal choices .  When you repent God becomes your all , God fights your battles and God surrounds you with His love and truth . 
Karen Kutto, Tue Jul 16 2019, Epitome of  wisdom ... 
Rachel Jolly, Mon Jul 15 2019, Divorce can be a great thing. It better being divorce than staying in a toxic marriage. And yes a psychologist can help people deal with emotional issues after divorce. The church and religion cannot do that.

Joyce Woodruff, Thu Jun 13 2019, I am whole only because I am in Christ Jesus. Jesus told the woman thou faith has made thee whole. 
BARofLUNCH, Mon Jun 10 2019, I get that it is crucial for me to be whole and content with my relationship with the Father in my singleness. What I find difficult is the contentment part of it. Often the desire to be in a relationship with someone can be a bit intense (especially when your friends who are younger than you are busy getting married and having kids) and during those times, it can be difficult to be content with the relationship I have with the Father (I call Him that cause it makes Him seem more personal, but I acknowledge that He is also God.. Is that right?).<br /><br />My question is, how do you navigate those moments when you long to be in a relationship with someone, but you know that you&#39;re not ready to step into that just yet? Also, how can you be sure that the desire you have is in fact pure? 
kenneth kaimenyi, Thu Jun 06 2019, so impressing..

Louise L, Sat Apr 27 2019, Why aren&#39;t people able to teach singledom WITHOUT it ALWAYS and FOREVER leading to finding a mate.  Not all singles want to find a mate ~ some are more interested in their anointing, purpose, living with an undivided heart, and learning who they are in Him and walking with Him.  This is tired. 
kirth Gonzales, Fri Apr 19 2019, Yes you are rip off two souls

fairymairah, Fri Apr 12 2019, Interesting ! ! ! ! 
annie jones, Thu Apr 11 2019, Paul stated that if you can control yourself, get married. A lot of people don&#39;t see what you go through being single. They are not thinking of fornication. They telling us to stay single when they are married. you don&#39;t have to go to bed alone, you don&#39;t have to get out of bed alone. You have someone to come home to or someone to come home to you. But when you are trying to stay true to God, when you are trying to stay obedient to the word of God and you have a need of a spouse and not a spouse, you can&#39;t say how we feel, because you don&#39;t know. You have what you need and who you need to stay faithful to God. People wants to give you all kinds of advice, do it yourself, get this or get that, but it all comes down to sexual sin. So when you have been alone as long as I have and you want to tell me.......oh you are never alone, then I want to tell you God is with me SPIRITUALLY, but protects me from the flesh. Spiritual warfare still invades my spirit everyday to have to fight off to keep me from sexual sin. it&#39;s is not easy:<br />Amen 
Sarah God's Best, Sun Apr 07 2019, Exactly what i needed as i plan to get into marriage. But my question is, i was in a life that wasn&#39;t so good n in it got a son out of wedlock in which this means i have already defiled my matrimonial bed😢😢...Lord forgive me.
